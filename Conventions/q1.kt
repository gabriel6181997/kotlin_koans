// Q1:Comparison
// Learn about operator overloading and how the different conventions for operations like ==, <, + work in Kotlin. Add the function compareTo to the class MyDate to make it comparable. After this, the code below date1 < date2 should start to compile.
// Note that when you override a member in Kotlin, the override modifier is mandatory.

data class MyDate(val year: Int, val month: Int, val dayOfMonth: Int) : Comparable<MyDate> {
  override fun compareTo(other: MyDate) = when {
      year != other.year -> year - other.year
      month != other.month -> month - other.month
      else -> dayOfMonth - other.dayOfMonth
  }
}

fun test(date1: MyDate, date2: MyDate) {
  // this code should compile:
  println(date1 < date2)
}
